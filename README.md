# Python Lessons

This site contains the resources for the python lessons delivered by Dave Rowan @ UiB.

Computers are great at doing things for us. To get the most of them, it helps if we can ask them to do things for us. This course will help you do that by teaching you the fundamentals of Python, a programming language.

## Aims of the course
- Understand [what Python is](Lessons/whatIsPython.md)
- Know what a [Jupyter notebook is](Lessons/jupyterNotebook.md) and be able to use notebooks
- Understand some [key concepts of Python](Lessons/keyConcepts.md)
- Use Python to [make choices](Lessons/makeChoices.md)
- Use Python to do the same thing [again and again](Lessons/loops.md)
- Use [other people's code](Lessons/externalCode.md)
- Know how to start [investigating programming errors](Lessons/programmingErrors.md)
- Use your [Jupyter notebook elsewhere](Lessons/exportScript.md)
- Understand a more complex example<!--This is doing some data visualisation, plotting points on a map from a csv file. -->

## Pre-requisites

**Required:**
- An internet connected device
  - It will be easiest for you if this is a device with a keyboard and a screen big enough to show two windows side by side but it _should be possible_ to complete on any internet connected device
- A google account. If you don't already have one you can sign up for a personal account at [https://accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com).

**Not required, but potentially useful**
- A github account. Sign up at [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)

## Other help

There will be a drop-in session (date and location TBC). Please come along with your Python questions for discussion and assistance.

## Other resources

The internet is full of resources to help you learn Python. I have collected some good ones on the [resources](Lessons/resources.md) page.
