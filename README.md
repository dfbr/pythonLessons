# Python Lessons

This site contains the resources for the python lessons delivered by Dave Rowan @ UiB.

Computers are great at doing things for us. To get the most of them, it helps if we can ask them to do things for us. This course will help you do that by teaching you the fundamentals of Python, a programming language.

## Aims of the course
- Understand [what Python is](Lessons/whatIsPython.md)
- Know what a [Jupyter notebook is](Lessons/jupyterNotebook.md) and be able to use notebooks
- Understand some [key concepts of Python](Lessons/keyConcepts.md)
- Use Python to [make choices](Lessons/makeChoices.md)
- Use Python to do the same thing [again and again](Lessons/loops.md)
- Use [other people's code](Lessons/externalCode.md)
- Know how to start [investigating programming errors](Lessons/programmingErrors.md)
- Use your [Jupyter notebook elsewhere](Lessons/exportScript.md)
- Understand a [more complex example](Lessons/complexExample.md)<!--This is doing some data visualisation, plotting points on a map from a csv file. -->

## Pre-requisites

**Required:**
- An internet connected device
  - It will be easiest for you if this is a device with a keyboard and a screen big enough to show two windows side by side but it _should be possible_ to complete on any internet connected device
- A google account. If you don't already have one you can sign up for a personal account at [https://accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com).

**Not required, but potentially useful**
- A github account. Sign up at [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)

## Schedule

Lessons:
- Wednesday 18th September, 12:15am - 4pm RFB Auditorium 5
- Wednesday 16th October, 12:15am - 4pm RFB Auditorium 5

Drop-in session:
- Thursday 26th September, 10:15am - 12 midday (GEO KvartSitten)

The schedule will vary based on the speed of work but we will have a short (5-10 minute) break at around 11am, lunch (30 minutes) at around 12:30 and a further short break at around 2pm.

## Other help

There will be a drop-in session (date and location TBC). Please come along with your Python questions for discussion and assistance.

## Other resources

The internet is full of resources to help you learn Python. I have collected some good ones on the [resources](Lessons/resources.md) page.

## Use of AI and programming tools

The aim of this course is that you're able to understand, edit and write Python scripts to accomplish your own goals and those that are set in the rest of your course here at UiB. How you achieve these learning goals is up to you.

If you find that using AI tools as a programming partner is useful then please use the tools to accelerate your learning. If however you [solely use AI](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-write-code/) and don't understand the output then you may need to use your own real intelligence further!
