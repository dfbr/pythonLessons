# Jupyter Notebooks

Please open a new browser window at: [https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/) and work along with the rest of this lesson.

- Cell
  - A cell groups together code or other information
  - You can have many cells in a notebook
  - There are different types of cell
- Code cell
  - This contains the code (instructions) that you want the computer to run
  - We will always be using Python in this course
  - You can use many different programming languages
- Markdown cell
  - Contains text in the [markdown format](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
  - This can be useful for adding notes or other output to your notebooks...
    - Reminders of why you did something in a certain way
    - Details of what you had to install to make something work
    - Expressions of frustration with programming
    - A todo list for your program
- Output
  - Shows the output of the cell above
  - Will show any output that you ask the computer to show, and
  - The output of the final instruction
  - Shows any error messages that your code creates
- Running a cell
  - Use the play button
- Running all of the cells
  - Use the double play button
- Restarting the kernel
  - Sometimes you want to clear all data in Python and start again (if you need to reimport a module or if you have made some types of programming error)
  - Click the `Restart the kernel` button
- Saving a notebook
  - Normally save as a `.ipynb` file
  - You can also export to a `.py` file if you want to have just the Python part
- Opening a notebook
  - You can open a file or a URL
  - We will be using some pre-built notebooks in this course which you will open from a url, e.g.:
    - First example here with url. Get people to run it.
