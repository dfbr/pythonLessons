# Installing Python and Jupyter on your own computer

In the class we will be using Google Colab. This lets us run our notebooks on a Google computer and all see the same thing.

While this works well for classes, you may want to install Python and Jupyter on your own computer. This means you can work when you're not on the internet and is probably a bit faster too.

## Instructions

Broadly, you need to install Python first and then install Jupyter. The details differ depending on your operating system.

### Windows

Python: [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) the current version of Python and run the installer.

Jupyter: 
- Open a command prompt (Start menu, search for "Command prompt")
- Run the command `pip install jupyterlab`

### Mac

Python: your system already has Python 3 installed. It may be an older version but for everything you are likely to be doing, it should be fine.

Jupyter: 
- Open a Terminal (Search for "Terminal")
- Run the command `pip install jupyterlab`

### Linux

Python: your system already has Python 3 installed. It may be an older version but for everything you are likely to be doing, it should be fine.

Jupyter: 
- Open a Terminal (Search for "Terminal")
- Run the command `pip install jupyterlab`

### Other

Please use google! Good luck :pray:

## Development environment

Once you have Python and Jupyter installed, there are many different development environments in which you can use them.

My favourite is Microsoft's VS Code with the Python and Jupyter extensions.
