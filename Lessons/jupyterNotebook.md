# Jupyter as used in Colab

This is your chance to get to know a bit about Jupyter notebooks. We'll go through some exercises together.

The first thing to do is open Google Colab at [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/). This gives us a blank Jupyter notebook. 

Now lets have a look at an [example notebook](http://colab.research.google.com/github/dfbr/pythonLessons/blob/main/Notebooks/jupyter.ipynb). (Ctrl/Command/Shift click on link to open in a new tab/window)

Throughout this course, we'll be using links directly to examples for exercises and examples (like the one above). 

You will probably need to click `Run anyway` when you open these notebooks.

## Key points

- A Jupyter notebook allows us to interactively develop and run Python code
- We can mix code and text cells
- We can run cells individually or run all of them
- We can save our notebook as a Python script
