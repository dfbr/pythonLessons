## Other resources

## Other topics that can be great to know about

### Python

- [Functions]() avoid repeating yourself by creating a function for tasks that you do a lot


### Other programming related resources

- [Using git(hub)](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git) for version control and collaboration
  - Git is a great tool to keep track of your work and the changes that you have made. In particular, it helps with:
    - Tracking changes and going back in time to when a program last worked
    - Collaborating with others on your programs
    - Sharing your work with others
    - Using the work of others as a basis for your work
- [Introduction to Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) from Harvard University
